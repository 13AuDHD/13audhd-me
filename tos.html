    <h2>1. The Basics</h2>
    <p>Welcome to <strong>13audhd.me</strong>. By visiting this site, you agree to these super simple terms. 
        If you don’t agree, that’s cool, but maybe don’t use the site. I won’t be offended.</p>

    <h2>2. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>Basically, don’t be a jerk. Don’t hack, spam, or use this site for anything shady. 
        If you break something (accidentally or on purpose), that’s on you.</p>

    <h2>3. No Guarantees</h2>
    <p>This site is provided “as-is.” I do my best to keep it running smoothly, but I make <em>zero guarantees</em> that it will always work perfectly, 
        be bug-free, or contain 100% accurate info. If something is broken, well… <strong>that’s life.</strong></p>

    <h2>4. Content Ownership</h2>
    <p>Unless stated otherwise, all content on this site belongs to me. Feel free to share stuff, but don’t claim it as your own or use it commercially 
        without asking first. That’s just rude.</p>

    <h2>5. External Links</h2>
    <p>Sometimes I link to other sites. If you click a link and something weird happens, 
        <strong>that’s between you and the internet</strong>. I’m not responsible for what happens outside of this site.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>I might update these terms at some point. If I do, I probably won’t make a big deal about it, so check back occasionally. 
        If you keep using the site, you’re agreeing to whatever changes I made (or didn’t make).</p>

    <h2>7. Legal Stuff</h2>
    <p>If something on this site somehow causes you an existential crisis, I am <strong>not</strong> legally responsible. 
        Use this site at your own risk. No warranties, no liabilities, no lawsuits, EVER.</p>

    <p><strong>That’s it. Be cool, enjoy the site, and let’s keep the internet fun :)</strong></p>
