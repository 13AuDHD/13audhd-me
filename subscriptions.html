    <h2>1. No Subscriptions… Yet</h2>
    <p>As of right now, I don’t offer subscriptions. But someday I might. If and when that happens, here’s what you need to know.</p>

    <h2>2. Free Content vs. Paid Content</h2>
    <p><strong>Most of my content is free,</strong> and that’s not changing. However, if I ever offer bonus content, 
        exclusive updates, or behind-the-scenes stuff for a price, it’ll be optional. You won’t have to pay to enjoy the basics.</p>

    <h2>3. Social Media Subscriptions</h2>
    <p>If I enable subscriptions on platforms like Twitter/X, Instagram, or TikTok, those will be managed by those platforms. 
        That means <strong>they handle the billing, not me</strong>. If you subscribe there, check their terms for payment, refunds, and cancellations.</p>

    <h2>4. Email Subscriptions</h2>
    <p>If I ever start an email list, you can subscribe (or unsubscribe) anytime. 
        No spam, no nonsense... just occasional updates about what’s happening. 
        I won’t sell your email or fill your inbox with junk. <em>Promise.</em></p>

    <h2>5. Payment and Cancellations</h2>
    <p>If I introduce paid subscriptions on this site, here’s the deal:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Billing:</strong> Payments will be processed through a secure third-party service (like Stripe or PayPal), not by me personally.</li>
        <li><strong>Cancellations:</strong> You can cancel anytime. No hard feelings.</li>
        <li><strong>Refunds:</strong> Depending on the service, refunds might not be available. 
            But if something goes wrong, reach out, and I’ll do my best to help.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>Since I don’t have subscriptions yet, this policy is basically a placeholder. 
        When (or if) I add subscriptions, I’ll update this page. If you’re still here, you’re agreeing to whatever changes I make.</p>

    <p><strong>That’s it! If you ever give me money, I’ll try to make it worth your while. If not, no worries, just enjoy the content :)</strong></p>
