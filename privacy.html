    <h2>What I Collect (Spoiler: Not Much)</h2>
    <p>I don’t collect your name, email, shoe size, or what you had for breakfast. The only thing I track is a 
        <strong>unique identifier cookie</strong> (basically a random number assigned to your visit). 
        This helps me figure out how many unique visitors drop by, what parts of the world they're from, and whether my content is reaching the right people. 
        It’s all <em>anonymous</em>—I have no idea who you are, just that <em>someone</em> visited.</p>

    <h2>Cookies (Not the Tasty Kind)</h2>
    <p>My web host (because I don’t run a server out of my truck) might use a tracking cookie, which I have no control over. 
        <strong>My own cookie</strong> is purely for analytics—no creepy ad tracking, no selling your info to the highest bidder. 
        If you don’t like cookies, you can disable them in your browser, but just know that the internet as a whole 
        <em>really</em> likes cookies, and I’m the least of your worries.</p>

    <h2>What I Do with This Info</h2>
    <p>I use the data to see what people are interested in, improve the site, and maybe add translations if needed. 
        I don’t share, sell, or trade it for magic beans.</p>

    <h2>Your Privacy Matters (But Also, Chill)</h2>
    <p>I respect your privacy. I’m not here to spy on you—I’m just trying to make my little corner of the internet better. 
        If you’re super paranoid, you can always use a VPN, clear your cookies, or browse in incognito mode. <em>You do you.</em></p>

    <p>If anything changes, I’ll update this page (or forget to, in which case… my bad).</p>

    <p><strong>That’s it! Enjoy the site, and don’t take the internet too seriously.</strong></p>
