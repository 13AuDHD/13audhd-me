    <h1 class="card-title">about me</h1>

    <div class="post-content">
      <p>I never quite fit. Not in classrooms, not in friendships, not even in my own skin for a long time. I was called “gifted,” but I always felt like I was glitching. The world never made sense the way everyone said it should.</p>

      <p>I grew up masking—hiding my overwhelm, scripting my words, obsessing over perfection, and enduring a constant low hum of anxiety. I was sensitive, smart, and silently falling apart. For years, I survived by adapting, performing, blending in. But blending in cost me everything: energy, identity, and self-worth.</p>

      <p>It wasn’t until adulthood—late adulthood—that I found the words that fit: autistic. ADHD. AuDHD. Suddenly, the pieces stopped floating and began to land. I started tracing back through my life, finding compassion where there used to be confusion, and finally learning to rebuild on truth instead of performance.</p>

      <p>Today, I live full-time in my Suburban, a blacked-out beast of a truck I call Horizon. I live simply, creatively, and sometimes chaotically, but for the first time, I live for me. Durango, CO is my base—a place of stillness, sky, and space. From here, I’m building something honest: websites, T-shirts, digital tools, and a safe place to be fully myself.</p>

      <p>I love deep forests, sharp knives, cold rivers, and soft hoodies. I collect memories, projects, and plushies. I make weird things for neurodivergent people. I write because sometimes it’s the only way I can speak.</p>

      <p>And if you’ve ever felt like you were too much or not enough—I hope you find a little bit of yourself here, too.</p>
